# Virtual_Assistant

- Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command. In this tutorial, I will teach you how you can make your personal A.I. assistant using Python. 

- As a Virtual Assistant, you will perform various administrative tasks, including answering emails, scheduling meetings and making travel arrangements. For this role, a strong Internet connection is required, along with experience using communication tools like Skype.

## What can this A.I. virtual assistant do for you?

- It can send emails for you.
- It can play music for you.
- It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
- It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser.
- It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.
- It can open github for you.
- It can open linkedln for you .

## To setup all the libraries use :-

- cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located.
- activate your virtualenv.
- run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell.

## Voice Change :-

- voice[0].id = Male voice 
- voice[1].id = Female voice

## Recapitulate

1. First of all, we have created a wishme() function that gives the functionality of greeting according to the system time to our A.I.
2. After wishme() function, we have created a takeCommand() function, which helps our A.I to take command from the user. This function is also responsible for returning the user's query in a string format.
3. We developed the code logic for opening different websites like google, youtube, and stack overflow.
4. Developed code logic for opening VS Code or any other application.
5. At last, we added functionality to send emails.

# Is it an A.I.?

- A lot of people will argue that the virtual assistant that we have created is not an A.I, but it is the output of the bunch of the statement. But, if we look at the very basic level, the sole purpose of A.I is to develop machines that can perform human tasks with the same effectiveness or even more effectively than humans.

- It is a fact that our virtual assistant is not a very good example of A.I., but it is an A.I. !
